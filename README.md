A Modern Electric Chariot
This product will come in to being as three basic iterations for use.
There shall be a small snap-to-fit small scale model.
There shall be a large radio controled scale model.
There shall be a full scale road-worthy, 50 states legal, vehicle.
There shall be several different versions of the full scale model.
The full scale models will primarily have an ancient Egyptian themed look, although a Roman themed chariot, a Greecian themed chariot and other themes may be acceptable additions to this project.

Depending on the course that development takes, there may be a comercial interest devoloped.
If that ends up being the case, a preliminary plan is to use crowdsourced funding, such as indiegogo for example.
There would be a likelihood that the two scale models could be used as the incentives, rewards or gifts for various donation levals.

The initial idea is to make these designs available as Creative Commons-Non-Commercial.
I reserve the right to comercialize these designs, but intend on leaving them as open source, open hardware as much as can be legally allowed as governed by laws applicable to California, USA.
